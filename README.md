Here i used pure JS to convert text or url into QR code. 
To run the program, first we have to use npm init and npm install to install all dependencies. 
Then you can run it with node index.js, where it will give the prompt in terminal itself where you can write the url or text to convert it into QR image. 
You can change the path where you want to change and change the name. 
The image will be saved to that path with the provided name and you can now scan it to see the url or text.
